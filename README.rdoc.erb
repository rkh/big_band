Note: Current plans involve separating BigBand into independent Sinatra extensions. For convenience (read: for myself) I will still
maintain BigBand as a collection of them all.

= BigBand <%= version %>
<%= docstring %>


== Extensions
<% extensions.each do |extension| %>

=== <%= extension.name %>

<%= extension.docstring %>

<% end %>


== Tool Integration
<% integration.each do |tool| %>

=== <%= tool.name %>

<%= tool.docstring %>

<% end %>

== Running specs

  rake spec

== Generating documentation

  rake doc

== Known Issues
* Reloader: Needs some more love, but it should not cause any harm.
* YARD integration: Routes don't show up in list of all methods. Would prefer a routes list, anyway. Some YARD digging ahead.

== LICENSE
(MIT/BSD-style license, compatible with Ruby license and GPL)

  <%= File.read("LICENSE").gsub(/\n/, "\n  ") %>
