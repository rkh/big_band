class BigBand < Sinatra::Base

  # This extension intends to ease setting up your stack. For instance, BigBand relies on methods from
  # an extension library (like AcitveSupport). However, instead of imposing such a library on you, it plays
  # well with all common extension libraries (like AcitveSupport, Extlib, Backports or Facets). Usually
  # BigBand will decide which library to use (if one of those has already been loaded, it will be used).
  # However, you might want to tell BigBand which library to use. +use(:active_support)+ has the advantage
  # (compared to +require("active_support")+), that it will only load the parts of ActiveSupport BigBand
  # relies on, instead of loading all parts of it â€“ see below on how to influence this behavior.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   class MyApp < BigBand
  #     use :core_ext   => :active_support, :orm     => :datamapper,
  #         :middleware => Rack::Reloader,  :testing => [:rspec, :webrat]
  #   end
  #
  # How you write the DSL really does not matter that much:
  #
  #   use :sequel               # Here, BigBand will try to figure out what kind of library Sequel is.
  #   use :orm, :sequel         # In this case, BigBand will try to use Sequel as ORM and configure it.
  #   use :orm => :sequel       # This syntax is handy for setting up multiple libraries in one line.
  #   use_orm :sequel           # This syntax is somewhat compatible with Merb.
  #   use.orm :sequel           # This is a side-product of the block style syntax below.
  #   use { orm :sequel }       # I like this syntax for setting up multiple libraries (very stacky).
  #   use { |u| u.orm :sequel } # Like the one above, but without abusing instance_eval (thus not changing self)
  #
  # Note that ultimately all but middleware map to +use_*+. Middleware gets handled directly inside +use+, since it
  # is the inherited behavior.
  #
  # But wait, didn't I just abuse +Sinatra::Base#use+? Yep, but that's ok. Passing something different than a Symbol
  # or a Hash as first argument will trigger the normal behavior (i.e. setup a Rack middleware).
  #
  # Also note that, per default, testing libraries will only be set up when running in test environment.
