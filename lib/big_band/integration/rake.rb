module BigBand::Integration
  # In your Rakefile, do the following:
  #
  #   require "big_band/integration/rake"
  #   include BigBand::Integration::Rake
  #
  #   RoutesTask.new
  #
  # then you can run 'rake routes' from your
  # project directory and it will list all routes
  # of your app. Per default it will scan for routes
  # defined in ruby files in the directories lib, app,
  # routes, models, views, and controllers (ignoring
  # non-existant directories, of course). You can change
  # that behavior by setting +source+ to another pattern:
  #
  #   RoutesTask.new { |t| t.source = "**/*.rb" }
  #
  # However, you may also just pass in a Sinatra app, so it
  # will not have to scan through the source files:
  #
  #   require "my_app"
  #   RoutesTask.new { |t| t.source = MyApp }
  #
  # Keep in mind that a broken my_app in this case would also make
  # your Rakefile unusable.
  #
  # Also, you may set another name for the task either by setting
  # the first argument or calling #name=:
  #
  #   RoutesTask.new(:some_routes) { |t| t.source = SomeApp }
  #   RoutesTask.new do |t|
  #     t.source = AnotherApp
  #     t.name   = :other_routes
  #   end
